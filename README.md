# The Book of Rust

_As performed by Randy Proctor_

This is my workspace as I go about reading and working through [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html).

Each chapter of the book has its own directory in this repo.

I am building the projects as I encounter them. For chapters with no projects I build my own small programs to tinker with the lessons that I learn.

Sometimes I jot notes.

As of my starting this project I am mostly experienced with JavaScript and some Java. I am greatly looking forward to getting "closer to the metal".
